# Deploying the Neighborly App with Azure Functions

## Project Overview
This is the final project of the Udacity Course. i am going to build an application called "Neighborly".
Neighborly is a Python Flask-Powered Web Application that allows neighbors to post advertisements for services and products they can offer.
